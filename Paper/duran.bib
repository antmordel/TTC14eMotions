	Abstract = {
The Knuth and Bendix test for local confluence of a term rewriting system involves generating superpositions of the left-hand sides, and for each superposition deriving a critical pair of terms and checking whether these terms reduce to the same term. We prove that certain superpositions, which are called composite because they can be split into other superpositions, do not have to be subjected to the critical-pair-joinability test; it suffices to consider only prime superpositions. As a corollary, this result settles a conjecture of Lankford that unblocked superpositions can be omitted. To prove the result, we introduce new concepts and proof techniques which appear useful for other proofs relating to the Church-Rosser property. This test has been implemented in the completion procedures for ordinary term rewriting systems as well as term rewriting systems with associative-commutative operators. Performance of the completion procedures with this test and without the test are compared on a number of examples in the Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL) being developed at General Electric Research and Development Center.},

@phdthesis{Hendrix:2008,
	Abstract = {This work develops new automated reasoning techniques for verifying the correctness of equationally specified programs. These techniques are not just theoretical, but have been implemented, and applied to actual program verification projects. Although the work spans several different areas, a major theme of this work is to develop better techniques at the boundary between decidable and undecidable problems. That is, this work seeks out not just positive decidability results, but ways to extend the underlying techniques to be effective on problems outside of decidable subclasses. For program verification to succeed, we feel that two important directions must be pursued: (1) considering more expressive logics to allow designers to more easily specify systems, and (2) develop decision procedures that can reason efficiently about these more sophsticated logics. This work pursues both directions, and the main topics addressed include: new decidability and undecidability results for equational tree automata (Chapter 3), order-sorted unification (Chapter 4), sufficient completeness for specifications with partiality and rewriting modulo axioms (Chapter 5), completeness problems for contextsensitive specifications (Chapter 6), coverset induction in membership equational logic (Chapter 7), and a case study for verifying properties of powerlists with the Maude ITP (Chapter 8). Each of these theoretical topics have lead to the development of new libraries and tools. Two of the tools have already been used in external projects including our tree automata library's integration into the ACTAS protocol verification tool [126], and the order-sorted unification procedures use in the Maude-NRL protocol analyzer [49].},

	Abstract = {Conceptual data modeling (CDM) methods for relational database systems allow expressing 
declarative constraints on (stored) tables and (computed) queries equally, and achieve greater abstraction 
than entity-relationship (E/R) modeling approaches by postponing the decision whether something is an 
entity or an attribute until the end of the conceptual design process, when this decision can be automated. 
CDM methods often lack a formal semantics, and must interoperate with larger systems, so it would be 
useful to have a formal semantics for conceptual data models in a wide-spectrum multiparadigm executable 
algebraic specification language such as Maude. Adapting techniques used for the similar cases of 
UML+OCL diagrams and RM-ODP specifications, we represent a conceptual data model using a property 
specification expressed as a Maude functional module, defining predicates to assert and check constraints 
on the model, and then use Maude's rewriting semantics in a system specification to execute a conceptual 
data model specification while enforcing constraints during concurrent edits to the database.
