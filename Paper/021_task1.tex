Task 1 comprises the generation of synthetic models (conforming the movie database metamodel~\cite{imdbcase}) from an input parameter $N \geq 0$. In the following we present an e-Motions based solution and a Maude solution. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{e-Motions-based solution.}

Following an e-Motions based approach, we define the abstract and concrete syntax and the behavior of our so-called \textit{Task 1 DSL}. Taking a parameter $N$ as input model, \textit{Task 1 DSL} generates a model containing synthetic data.

As it has been introduced in Section~\ref{sub:emotions}, the abstract syntax of a DSL is given in e-Motions by means of a Ecore metamodel. In fact, this metamodel is provided beforehand in~\cite{imdbsources}. We call this metamodel \textit{Movies MM}. However, the \textit{parameter N} has to be modeled in some way, since in e-Motions the state is just a model. Hence, a new concept call \code{Parameter} has been added to Movies MM. This results in a so-called \textit{Movies* MM}. The class \code{Parameter} has two integer attributes \code{nP} and \code{nN}, positive graphs and negative graphs, due to data generation following Henshing graphs~\cite{henshing} is divided into positive and negative cases.

For the concrete syntax, Fig.~\ref{fig:concreteSyntax} shows how an image has been attached to each concept modeled in the Movies* MM. The behavior of this \textit{Task 1 DSL} is given by means of two in-place rules: \code{createPositive} and \code{createNegative}. Figure~\ref{fig:createPositive} shows the \code{createPositive} rule, which takes an object \code{p} of type \textit{Parameter} with \textit{nP} attribute greater or equal than $0$ and, after the rule application, synthetic data conforming to the Henshin rules~\cite{henshing} are created. Fig.~\ref{fig:createNegative} shows the \code{createNegative} rule, which is analogously defined.

Once the syntax and the behavior of the system has been coded, the user may specify a model, which conforms to \textit{Movies* MM}, containing an object \code{Parameter} with its two attributes \code{nP} and \code{nN} properly set. This model is used as initial model of the execution.

This solution is really close to the problem specification~\cite{imdbcase}. Both Fig.~\ref{fig:task1} and Fig.~2 in~\cite{imdbcase} specifying the data generation are almost the same. This solution demonstrates how close is the solution to the problem domain, and how user-friendly is e-Motions.

\subsubsection{Maude version.}
This proposal of Task 1 consists of a object-based Maude specification, which is composed by two main modules: the \code{MOVIES@MM} module defining the classes structure and the \code{TASK1} module defining the solution. The solution is coded using again two rules: \code{createPositive} and \code{createNegative}. One could realized that the Maude version is very much like the e-Motions version. In fact, the former is almost the textual version of the latter. Listing~\ref{lst:createPositive} shows the \code{createPositive} Maude rule that takes the \code{createPositive(N:Nat)} message and a \code{freshOid} auxiliary message---used to create new object identifiers---and returns such a object configuration conforming the Henshin specification~\cite{imdbcase}.

The messages \code{createPositive} and \code{createNegative} are generated in zero-rewrite steps with the equation showed in Listing~\ref{lst:createexampleeq}.
