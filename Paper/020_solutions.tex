\delete{Since e-Motions supports in a very intuitive, user-close and visual way, we show how the IMDb problem~\cite{imdbcase} can be solved using it. Each task is solved using the definition of a DSL, which shares in general the abstract and concrete syntax. The rewrite rules defining the behavior depends on the solution given. All rewrite rules are \textit{instantaneous}, since the case to be solved do not have time requirements.}

We show how the IMDb problem can be solved using e-Motions tool. Each task is figured out using the definition of a DSL, which shares, in general, the abstract and concrete syntax. In fact, the abstract syntax is given in advance in~\cite{imdbsources}. The rewrite rules defining the behavior depends on the concrete task and its solution. All rewrite rules are \textit{instantaneous}, since the case to be solved do not have time requirements.

e-Motions is very general: it supports OCL expressions and time requirements. This makes that the Maude code generated by e-Motions tool is not as time performant as desired. Together with the e-Motions solution we present a optimized Maude solution for each task.

e-Motions-based solution which are visual, very intuitive and very close to the problem domain are shown against Maude-based solution. Although Maude-based solutions are also very expressive, the fact that  

Both e-Motions-based and Maude-based solutions are very expressive and very close to the problem domain

Finally, although e-Motions is presented as a Eclipse tool, we run the simulations with the code generated by it directly in a Maude instance, since the transformation from a e-Motions-based system into Maude code takes time.
